# The name of the demo.
title: KeyFrame Media Compliance


# A short description of the demo.
thumbnail_summary: KeyFrame is a SaaS application that automates reviews for media content against internal rules, corporate identity and public media regulations. It speeds up an important and usually manual and expensive process in enterprises.



# [Optional] A summary of the demo's intention. Markdown supported.
purpose: Enterprises, especially in the B2C space have to adhere to a multitude of internal regulations, but also external guidelines on what they are allowed to show in public advertisement. Internal rules may include tonality, brand guidelines and corporate identity guidelines. External guidelines include elements like child safety, animal welfare, regulations on what constitutes misleading advertisements, etc. This is a time consuming process that has to be conducted in every country a media asset is shown, due to varying local legislation.


# [Optional] A summary of the demo's business value. Markdown supported.
business_value: KeyFrame automates the review process and aids human reviewers through the heavy lifting and tedious checklist process. In a typical enterprise setting this process can take between 3-4 weeks, resulting in significant labor costs and lost revenue due to delayed advertising.


# [Optional] A summary of the demo's technical value. Markdown supported.
technical_value: This solution demonstrates how to integrate Gemini models and other Google ML APIs into a purpose build, secure and scalable frontend, tailored towards the key audience. It also acts as an example of how we can present Google technologies in an accessible customer focused (rather than Google product focused) way with reasonable effort. The initial demo was build within 2 days.
