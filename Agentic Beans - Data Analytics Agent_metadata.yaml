# The name of the demo.
title: "[DO NOT APPROVE] Agentic Beans - Data Analytics Agent"


# A short description of the demo.
thumbnail_summary: See how Data Analytics agents are revolutionizing the industry. This demo showcases a transformative approach to Data Analytics, featuring autonomous data pipelines, AI-driven forecasting, and metadata-powered insights that unlock new levels of efficiency and intelligence.



# [Optional] A summary of the demo's intention. Markdown supported.
purpose: |
  To demonstrate the next generation of data analytics on Google Cloud, showcasing how AI Agents can automate complex tasks, empower users with natural language, and unlock proactive insights. This demo illustrates a shift from reactive data analysis to a fully autonomous, intelligent, and resilient data ecosystem.
  
  We will showcase:
  *   **Autonomous Data Quality & Remediation:** A "self-healing" data pipeline that uses agents to detect, diagnose, and fix data issues without human intervention.
  *   **Metadata-Powered Agent Building:** How agents leverage a deep understanding of data assets to translate natural language questions into precise SQL queries.
  *   **AI-Driven Forecasting:** The power of agents to generate accurate forecasts using foundation models, turning any user into a data scientist.
  



# [Optional] A summary of the demo's business value. Markdown supported.
business_value: |
  Adopting an agent-driven approach to Data Analytics provides significant business value by:
  
  *   **Reducing Operational Overhead:** Automate data pipeline repair to minimize downtime and free up engineers from manual fixes.
  *   **Accelerating Time-to-Insight:** Empower business users with natural language queries and AI-forecasting, reducing reliance on technical teams.
  *   **Improving Decision Accuracy:** Drive strategy with trusted, high-quality data through proactive data quality checks and sophisticated forecasting.
  *   **Enhancing Data Trust:** Build a reliable data foundation by autonomously finding and correcting data inconsistencies, ensuring accuracy for all analytics.
  



# [Optional] A summary of the demo's technical value. Markdown supported.
technical_value: |
  This demo showcases the technical power of building AI Agents on Google Cloud:
  
  *   **Advanced Agentic Architecture:** See a coordinator agent pattern built with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Gemini to orchestrate specialized sub-agents.
  *   **Autonomous "Self-Healing" Pipelines:** A practical workflow integrating BigQuery, Dataplex, and the Data Engineering Agent, using an "LLM as a Judge" for automated code validation.
  *   **Foundation Models in BigQuery:** Hands-on use of TimesFM (`AI.FORECAST`) and Gemini (`AI.GENERATE_BOOL`) for advanced forecasting and multimodal queries.
  *   **Metadata-Driven Intelligence:** The BigQuery Knowledge Engine and vector embeddings create a rich semantic layer for highly accurate Natural Language to SQL.
  *   **And More...**
